# Case Study kNN Classification
 
In this Case Study I have implemented k-Nearest Neighbor classification using Python.

K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). KNN has been used in statistical estimation and pattern recognition already in the beginning of 1970's as a non-parametric technique..
